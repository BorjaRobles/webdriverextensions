WebDriver Extensions
===================

WebDriver Extensions is a framework build on top of Selenium/WebDriver,
designed to make tests more readable, reusability and maintainable. This is
achivied by combining the [Page Object Pattern](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects)
with the [Bot Pattern](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/BotStyleTests).

What is included in this framework?
- A [Maven Archetype](https://github.com/webdriverextensions/webdriverextensions-archetype-quickstart#webdriver-extension-archetype-quickstart) for creating new projects
- A [Maven Plugin](https://github.com/webdriverextensions/webdriverextensions-maven-plugin#webdriver-extensions-maven-plugin) to manage, download and install drivers
- JUnit Runners for running Selenium/WebDriver tests locally or remotely against multiple browsers
- Abstract classes for modeling your website like WebComponent (an extendable WebElement), WebPage and WebSite
- A Bot class providing static methods for interacting, asserting and checking conditions of WebElements, WebComponents, WebPages and WebSites

### Under Development
